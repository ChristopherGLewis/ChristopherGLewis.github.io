## Welcome to the GitHub Pages of Christopher Lewis

My GitHub has several projects that I'm currently working on.

### Projects

- [ZertoModule](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/ZertoModule) - a project that wraps the [Zerto](http://www.Zerto.com/) REST API in a PowerShell module.
- [GridMVCPlus](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/GridMVCPlus) - My minor updates to the original CodePlex [GridMVC](http://gridmvc.codeplex.com/)
- [RollingFileWithCleanupAppender](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/RollingFileWithCleanupAppender) - A Log4Net appender based on the RollingFileAppender that does file clean up based on age or max file counts.

Please feel free to contribute.

### Jekyll notes (ignore)

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/ChristopherGLewis.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
